CS220 project 5 Interpreter

Read the project5.pdf file. After developing and testing your env.py and interpreter.py files, run the submit.py script to create the submission zip file. Note: you must run this script to create the zip file, which you submit to Moodle. Do not make the zip file in any other way.
